    <h4>Description</h4>    
    <p>This is my fun take on air-fried elote ribs. Cutting the corn this way causes them to curl up in the shape of ribs once cooked. This also makes the corn a lot easier to handle and eat, not to mention a lot less messy.</p>   
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ears fresh corn, husked</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons lime juice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Mexican-style hot sauce (such as Valentina®)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons crumbled cotija cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped cilantro</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps to make Air Fryer Corn Ribs</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Place an ear of corn on a cutting board and cut in half lengthwise. Cut each half in half lengthwise. Repeat with remaining ear of corn. You should have 8 "ribs" total.</li>
      <li>Whisk olive oil, chili powder, garlic powder, and black pepper together in a bowl until smooth. Brush onto both sides of each rib and place in the air fryer basket.</li>
      <li>Air fry for 12 minutes, flipping halfway through the cook time.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile whisk mayonnaise, lime juice, and hot sauce together until thoroughly combined.</li>
      <li>Transfer corn ribs to a serving plate. Drizzle sauce over the ribs and top with cotija cheese and cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
